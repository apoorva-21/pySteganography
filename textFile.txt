Steganography is a branch of information hiding. It allows the people to communicate secretly. Asincreasingly more material becomes available electronically, the influence of steganography on our liveswill continue to grow. Many confidential information were leaked to a rival firm using steganographic toolsthat hid the information in music and picture files. The application of steganography is an importantmotivation for feature selection. A new steganographic algorithm for 8bit(grayscale) or 24bit (colour image) is presented in this article, based on Logical operation.
